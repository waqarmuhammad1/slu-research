=================================	EPSCOR PROJECT		=====================================================
- Learn about serverless.
- Work with alessio and Figure out whats wrong with openwhisk configuration.
- How we can use python script in openwhisk environments.
- What are our options to deploy code scripts in openwhisk.
- Figure out how to run machine learning algorithms inside openwhisk.
- Should be able to provide a template file to the script defining target, training variables and which algorithms to use and to set     different parameters of the algorithm.
- Create some kind of UI/Dashboard to upload data sets and to apply machine learning algorithms onto those datasets.
- Instead of template user should be able to upload CSV, Excel and text files onto UI.
- Create line graphs to show performance of algorithms.
- Create algorithm comparison graph.
- Create error bar graph to show the performance of docker and openwhisk.
- Start working on manuscript.

=================================	Voice Control drone	======================================================
- Create feature comparison sheet of popular NLP apis.
- Meet with Matthew to learn about what he is doing on the project, how much he has done and what left.
- Find some better speech to text api to input user voice for drone commands.
- Implement finite state machine in python.
- Create client server architecture for communication between drone and controller(user input device)
- Parse user commands and create a key word based dictionary of user commands.

=================================	Internship meetings	=======================================================
